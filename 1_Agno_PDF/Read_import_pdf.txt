importt  restructions/taxes  on  electroniques  devices  to  morocco  
Importing  electronic  devices  into  Morocco  involves  compliance  with  customs  regulations,  
import
 
duties,
 
taxes,
 
and
 
specific
 
standards.
 
Below
 
is
 
a
 
detailed
 
overview
 
of
 
the
 
import
 
laws,
 
restrictions,
 
taxes,
 
and
 
requirements
 
for
 
electronic
 
devices
 
in
 
Morocco,
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
latest
 
available
 
information,
 
including
 
relevant
 
web
 
sources.
 
1.  Import  Regulations  for  Electronic  Devices  
Morocco  has  specific  regulations  to  ensure  the  quality,  safety,  and  compliance  of  imported  
electronic
 
devices.
 
These
 
regulations
 
are
 
enforced
 
by
 
the
 
Moroccan
 
Customs
 
Service
 
(Administration
 
des
 
Douanes
 
et
 
Impôts
 
Indirects)
 
and
 
other
 
authorities,
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
Ministry
 
of
 
Industry
 
and
 
Trade
.
 
●  Verification  of  Conformity  (VoC)  Program :  ○  Since  February  1,  2020,  Morocco’s  Verification  of  Conformity  (VoC)  
program,
 
managed
 
by
 
the
 
Ministry
 
of
 
Industry,
 
Investment,
 
Trade,
 
Green
 
and
 
Digital
 
Economy
 
(MCINET)
,
 
requires
 
that
 
imported
 
electronic
 
devices
 
comply
 
with
 
Moroccan
 
technical
 
regulations
 
and
 
quality
 
standards
 
(e.g.,
 
Moroccan  Standards  -  NM ).  ○  Covered  electronics  include  consumer  products  like  mobile  phones,  
computers,
 
and
 
household
 
appliances.
 
Specific
 
components,
 
such
 
as
 
batteries,
 
may
 
also
 
require
 
conformity
 
checks.
 ○  A  Certificate  of  Conformity  (CoC)  is  mandatory  for  customs  clearance  and  
must
 
be
 
obtained
 
from
 
an
 
approved
 
inspection
 
body
 
(e.g.,
 
Intertek,
 
SGS,
 
or
 Bureau  Veritas)  in  the  exporting  country,  such  as  the  UK.  ○  Some  products  may  require  destination  inspection  in  Morocco  to  verify  
compliance,
 
particularly
 
for
 
complex
 
electronics
 
or
 
components
 
like
 
motor
 vehicle  spare  parts  (e.g.,  batteries).  ○  Exporters  must  provide  technical  documentation  to  demonstrate  compliance  
with
 
Moroccan
 
standards.
 
Failure
 
to
 
provide
 
a
 
CoC
 
can
 
result
 
in
 
delays,
 
fines,
 or  rejection  of  the  shipment.  ●  Customs  Documentation :  ○  Required  documents  for  importing  electronics  include:  ■  Commercial  Invoice :  Must  include  the  supplier’s  letterhead,  HS  
(Harmonized
 
System)
 
code,
 
value
 
of
 
goods,
 
currency
 
for
 
payment,
 
and
 
buyer’s
 
address.
 
Pro-forma
 
invoices
 
are
 
acceptable
 
in
 
most
 
cases.  ■  Bill  of  Lading :  Must  show  Morocco  as  the  final  destination  and  the  
UK  as  the  point  of  origin.  ■  Certificate  of  Non-Manipulation :  Required  to  confirm  that  goods  
have
 
not
 
undergone
 
substantial
 
transformation
 
(e.g.,
 
repacking
 
or
 
relabeling)  in  a  third  country,  especially  for  eligibility  under  trade  
agreements  like  the  UK-Morocco  Association  Agreement.  ■  Import  Commitment  (Engagement  d’Importation) :  Authorization  
from
 
the
 
Foreign
 
Exchange
 
Office
 
for
 
transferring
 
foreign
 
currency
 
to
 
pay  foreign  suppliers.  ■  Customs  Declaration  (Déclaration  de  Douane) :  Required  for  all  
imports
 
through
 
ports
 
or
 
airports.
 
For
 
postal
 
shipments,
 
a
 
simplified
 
form  at  the  post  office  may  replace  this.  ■  Certificate  of  Conformity :  As  mentioned,  required  for  regulated  electronics.  ○  Additional  technical  documentation  (e.g.,  product  specifications,  safety  
certifications)  may  be  requested  to  assist  customs  officials.  ●  Rules  of  Origin :  ○  Under  the  UK-Morocco  Association  Agreement  (successor  to  the  
EU-Morocco
 
Agreement,
 
effective
 
post-Brexit),
 
electronic
 
devices
 
originating
 
in
 
the
 
UK
 
can
 
benefit
 
from
 
tariff-free
 
or
 
reduced-tariff
 
treatment
 
if
 
they
 
meet
 
rules
 
of
 
origin
 
requirements.
 
This
 
typically
 
means
 
the
 
goods
 
must
 
be
 
wholly
 
obtained
 
in
 
the
 
UK
 
or
 
have
 
undergone
 
sufficient
 
transformation
 
(e.g.,
 
at
 
least
 35%  regional  value  content  from  UK  materials  and  processing).  ○  A  Statement  on  Origin  or  supplier’s  declaration,  signed  by  the  exporter,  is  
required
 
to
 
claim
 
preferential
 
treatment.
 
For
 
example:
 
“We
 
certify
 
that
 
the
 
goods
 
named
 
in
 
this
 
invoice
 
are
 
manufactured
 
and
 
originated
 
in
 
the
 
UK.”
 ○  Goods  transshipped  through  a  third  country  must  not  undergo  substantial  
transformation
 
(e.g.,
 
repacking
 
or
 
relabeling)
 
to
 
maintain
 
preferential
 
status.
 ●  Prohibited  and  Restricted  Items :  ○  Prohibited  Items :  Weapons,  ammunition,  narcotics,  psychotropic  
substances,
 
and
 
media
 
contrary
 
to
 
public
 
morals
 
or
 
order
 
(e.g.,
 
pornography)
 
are  banned.  These  restrictions  may  apply  to  certain  electronic  devices  
containing  prohibited  content  or  components.  ○  Restricted  Items :  Electronic  devices  for  personal  use  (e.g.,  laptops,  phones,  
cameras)
 
are
 
generally
 
allowed
 
without
 
an
 
import
 
license,
 
provided
 
they
 
are
 
declared
 
and
 
accompanied
 
by
 
appropriate
 
documentation
 
(e.g.,
 
proof
 
of
 
purchase).  ○  Radio  Equipment :  Devices  with  radio  or  telecommunications  functions  (e.g.,  
mobile
 
phones,
 
Wi-Fi
 
routers)
 
may
 
require
 
approval
 
from
 
the
 
National
 
Telecommunications
 
Regulatory
 
Agency
 
(ANRT)
 
to
 
ensure
 
compliance
 
with
 
Moroccan
 
frequency
 
and
 
safety
 
standards.
 ○  Drones :  Considered  restricted  due  to  potential  security  concerns.  Importing  
drones
 
typically
 
requires
 
a
 
permit
 
from
 
the
 
Ministry
 
of
 
Interior
 
or
 
other
 
relevant  authorities.  ●  Personal  Use  Exemptions :  ○  Travelers  can  import  electronics  for  personal  use  (e.g.,  phones,  laptops,  
cameras)
 
without
 
an
 
import
 
license,
 
but
 
these
 
must
 
be
 
declared
 
if
 
their
 
value
 
exceeds  duty-free  allowances  (e.g.,  MAD  2,000  for  residents).
 ○  For  personal  electronics  exceeding  the  duty-free  limit,  customs  duties  and  
taxes
 
apply
 
unless
 
exempted
 
under
 
specific
 
conditions.
 
2.  Import  Duties  and  Taxes  
●  Customs  Duties :  ○  Import  duties  on  electronic  devices  typically  range  from  2.5%  to  35% ,  
depending
 
on
 
the
 
product’s
 
HS
 
code
 
and
 
whether
 
it
 
qualifies
 
for
 
preferential
 
treatment  under  the  UK-Morocco  Association  Agreement.  ○  For  electronics  requiring  further  processing  or  assembly  in  Morocco  (e.g.,  
components  for  manufacturing),  duties  may  be  reduced.  ○  To  confirm  the  exact  duty  rate,  use  the  Moroccan  Customs  Tariff  Database  or  consult  the  Moroccan  Customs  Service  (www.douane.gov.ma).  ●  Value  Added  Tax  (VAT) :  
○  A  VAT  of  20%  is  applied  to  most  imported  electronic  devices,  calculated  on  
the  CIF  (Cost,  Insurance,  Freight)  value  plus  import  duties.  ○  Reduced  VAT  rates  of  7%  or  10%  may  apply  to  specific  electronics  or  
components,  but  this  is  less  common.  ○  VAT  is  payable  at  the  time  of  customs  clearance  unless  the  importer  qualifies  
for  exemptions  (e.g.,  under  investment  programs  or  trade  agreements).  ●  Para-Fiscal  Tax :  ○  A  0.25%  para-fiscal  tax  is  applied  to  imports  to  fund  activities  like  technical  
inspections,  export  promotion,  and  industrial  development.  ○  Exemptions  from  the  para-fiscal  tax  apply  to  goods  qualifying  for  special  
customs
 
procedures,
 
investment
 
programs,
 
or
 
preferential
 
trade
 
agreements.
 ●  Recent  Tariff  Changes :  ○  As  of  April  2025,  Morocco  increased  customs  duties  on  household  appliances  
from
 
2.5%
 
to
 
30%
 
to
 
support
 
the
 
national
 
appliance
 
industry.
 
This
 
may
 
affect
 
certain
 
electronic
 
devices
 
classified
 
as
 
household
 
appliances
 
(e.g.,
 
refrigerators,
 
washing
 
machines).
 
It’s
 
unclear
 
if
 
this
 
applies
 
to
 
all
 
electronics,
 
so
 
check
 
the
 
specific
 
HS
 
code
 
with
 
the
 
Moroccan
 
Customs
 
Service.
 
3.  Additional  Considerations  
●  Standards  and  Safety :  ○  Electronic  devices  must  comply  with  Moroccan  Standards  (NM) ,  managed  
by
 
the
 
Moroccan
 
Standards
 
Institute
 
(IMANOR)
.
 
For
 
example,
 
devices
 
must
 
meet
 
safety
 
and
 
electromagnetic
 
compatibility
 
requirements,
 
similar
 
to
 
EU  CE  marking  standards.  ○  Non-compliant  devices  may  be  subject  to  testing  upon  arrival,  which  can  cause  delays.  Ensure  pre-export  verification  through  an  accredited  body.  ●  Currency  Regulations :  ○  There  is  no  limit  on  importing  foreign  currency  (e.g.,  GBP,  USD)  to  pay  for  
electronics,
 
but
 
amounts
 
equivalent
 
to
 
MAD
 
100,000
 
or
 
higher
 
must
 
be
 
declared  to  customs.  
○  The  Moroccan  Dirham  (MAD)  cannot  be  imported  or  exported,  so  payments  
must
 
be
 
made
 
in
 
foreign
 
currency,
 
and
 
an
 
exchange
 
slip
 
may
 
be
 
required
 
for
 re-exporting  unspent  currency.  ●  Intellectual  Property  (IP) :  ○  IP  rights  are  territorial,  so  UK-registered  IP  protections  do  not  apply  in  
Morocco.
 
Exporters
 
should
 
consider
 
registering
 
trademarks
 
or
 
patents
 
in
 
Morocco
 
to
 
protect
 
electronic
 
devices
 
with
 
proprietary
 
technology.
 
Contact
 
the
 
Moroccan
 
Office
 
of
 
Industrial
 
and
 
Commercial
 
Property
 
(OMPIC)
 
or
 
the
 
UK’s  International  IP  Service  for  guidance.  ●  Sanctions  and  Embargoes :  ○  As  of  the  latest  information,  Morocco  is  not  subject  to  UK  or  international  
sanctions
 
that
 
would
 
restrict
 
electronics
 
imports.
 
However,
 
confirm
 
with
 
the
 
UK’s
 
Export
 
Control
 
Joint
 
Unit
 
(ECJU)
 
and
 
Moroccan
 
authorities
 
for
 
any
 
updates.  ●  Data  Protection  for  Smart  Devices :  ○  Smart  electronics  (e.g.,  IoT  devices,  phones)  that  process  personal  data  must  
comply
 
with
 
Morocco’s
 
Data
 
Protection
 
Law
 
(Law
 
No.
 
09-08).
 
Direct
 
marketing
 
via
 
electronic
 
devices
 
(e.g.,
 
email,
 
SMS)
 
requires
 
prior
 
consent
 from  users,  except  for  existing  customers  purchasing  similar  products.  
4.  Practical  Steps  for  Importers  
1.  Classify  the  Goods :  Determine  the  correct  HS  code  for  your  electronic  devices  
using
 
the
 
Moroccan
 
Customs
 
Tariff
 
Database
 
to
 
identify
 
duties,
 
taxes,
 
and
 restrictions.  2.  Obtain  a  Certificate  of  Conformity :  Arrange  for  pre-export  verification  through  an  accredited  body  (e.g.,  Intertek)  to  ensure  compliance  with  Moroccan  standards.  3.  Prepare  Documentation :  Ensure  all  required  documents  (invoice,  bill  of  lading,  
CoC,  import  commitment,  etc.)  are  complete  and  accurate.  4.  Claim  Preferential  Treatment :  Provide  a  Statement  on  Origin  to  benefit  from  tariff  
reductions  under  the  UK-Morocco  Association  Agreement.  5.  Check  Radio  Equipment  Requirements :  For  devices  with  wireless  functions,  
confirm
 
compliance
 
with
 
ANRT
 
regulations
 
and
 
obtain
 
necessary
 
approvals.
 6.  Hire  a  Customs  Agent :  Use  a  freight  forwarder  or  customs  broker  (e.g.,  UPS,  
TecEx)  to  navigate  Moroccan  customs  procedures  and  avoid  delays.  
7.  Declare  Currency :  If  importing  high-value  electronics,  declare  foreign  currency  
exceeding  MAD  100,000  and  retain  exchange  slips.  8.  Verify  Destination  Inspection :  Confirm  if  your  electronics  require  inspection  upon  arrival  in  Morocco  and  prepare  for  potential  testing.  
5.  Key  Resources  
●  Moroccan  Customs  Service : www.douane.gov.ma for  tariffs,  documentation,  and  regulations.  ●  Moroccan  Standards  Institute  (IMANOR) :  For  NM  standards  and  compliance  
requirements  (website  in  French).  ●  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade :  For  VoC  program  details  and  product  lists.  ●  UK  Export  Support  Service :  For  guidance  on  exporting  to  Morocco.  ●  Intertek  or  SGS :  For  obtaining  Certificates  of  Conformity.  ●  UK-Morocco  Association  Agreement :  For  rules  of  origin  and  tariff  benefits.  
Notes  
●  Regulations  may  vary  for  specific  electronic  devices  (e.g.,  medical  devices,  drones),  
so
 
provide
 
details
 
about
 
the
 
products
 
for
 
a
 
more
 
tailored
 
response.
 ●  The  increased  duties  on  household  appliances  (30%  as  of  April  2025)  may  impact  
certain
 
electronics,
 
but
 
clarification
 
is
 
needed
 
for
 
non-appliance
 
devices.
 
Always
 
verify
 
with
 
the
 
Moroccan
 
Customs
 
Service
 
for
 
the
 
latest
 
HS
 
code-specific
 
rates.
 ●  For  complex  or  high-volume  imports,  consult  a  customs  broker  or  contact  the  Moroccan  Customs  Service  directly  via www.douane.gov.ma.
